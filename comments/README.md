Comments are simple we have

- Single-line comments
- Multi-line comments
- Docs comments

I'm not going into much detail since comments are something simple that can be learn fast by yourself
But just in case what are comments? comments are part of the code but the compiler is not executing anything about it so if you write a variable but is commented is not going to be stored or anything.

It can be useful for documentation or to debug when you think something is breaking the code and you commented out in order to see if that peace of code is the problem.

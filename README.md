## 📔 Topics

- [Comments](./comments/README.md)
- [Variables](./variables/README.md)
- [Shadowing](./shadowing/README.md)

## 🧰 Utils

There is a simple script to create a new topic and add a readme about it

```bash
chmod +x ./new_topic.sh
./new_topic.sh
```

This will ask you about the topic and execute a cargo new with that prompt, then it will add a readme with an H1 about that topic.

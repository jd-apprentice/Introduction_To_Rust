## 🧰 Utils

There is a simple script to create a new topic and add a readme about it, along with the section in the general readme

```bash
chmod +x ./new_topic.sh
./new_topic.sh
```

This will ask you about the topic and execute a cargo new with that prompt, then it will add a readme with an H1 about that topic.

## 📔 Topics

- [Comments](./comments/README.md)
- [Variables](./variables/README.md)
- [Shadowing](./shadowing/README.md)
- [Debug](./debug/README.md)

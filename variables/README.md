# ğŸ”¤ Variables

Variables are defined in several ways which the most basic example could be ->

```rs
// <reserved-word> <variable-name>: <T> = <value>

// https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/variables.html

let first_name: &str = "Jonathan";
let last_name: &str = "Dyallo";
```

For numbers could be something like this ->

```rs
let age: i32 = 27;
let date_of_birth: i32 = 1995;
```
